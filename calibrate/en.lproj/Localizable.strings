Temporary cookies, or \"session cookies\" or \"transient cookies\", are cookies that are deleted after a user leaves an online service and closes his browser. In such a cookie, e.g. the contents of a shopping cart are stored in an online store or a login jam. The term \"permanent\" or \"persistent\" refers to cookies that remain stored even after the browser has been closed. Thus, e.g. the login status will be saved if users visit it after several days. Likewise, in such a cookie the interests of the users can be stored, which are used for range measurement or marketing purposes. A \"third-party cookie\" refers to cookies that are offered by providers other than the person who manages the online offer (otherwise, if it is only their cookies, this is called \"first-party cookies\").\n\nWe can use temporary and permanent cookies and clarify this in the context of our privacy policy.\n\nIf users do not want cookies stored on their computer, they will be asked to disable the option in their browser's system settings. Saved cookies can be deleted in the system settings of the browser.

GDPR), we make use of content or services offered by third-party providers in order to provide their content and services, such as include videos or fonts (collectively referred to as \"content\").\n\nThis always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content perceive the IP address of the users, since they could not send the content to their browser without the IP address.

If you don't find a setting named 'Overscan', look for 'Just Scan' (LG), 'Screen Fit' (Samsung), 'Full Pixel' (Sony), 'Dot by Dot' (Pioneer), 'Wide' (Visio), 'Pixel to Pixel', '1:1 pixel mapping', or 'Native' and turn it *on*. Every TV manufacturer seems to have a different name for that.";
"overscanBullet2"	= "In the test pattern, you should be able to see all eight circles completely. Also, in the six inner rectangles you should be able to see thin vertical lines (on the left-hand side), a checkerboard pattern, and thin horizontal lines (right-hand side).";

// sharpness
